			<h3>
			Welcome!
			</h3>
			<p>The 2017 ACM WearSys workshop focuses on advances and discussions on how wearable technologies can shape mobile computing, systems and applications research. 
			The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum to bring together researchers and design experts to discuss how wearable technologies have, and can, 
			complement mobile systems research, and vice-versa. It also aims to provide a launchpad for bold and visionary ideas for wearable systems research. 
			The 2017 ACM WearSys workshop comes at a critical time–juncture where wearable devices are proliferating commercially, and when mobile systems research is 
			increasingly adopting wearable devices; mostly for primary and auxiliary sensing. The off-the-shelf availability of wearable devices today has only 
			improved and shaped new directions for mobile and wireless systems research. This is an exciting time where wearables are seeming to spearhead advancements 
			in technology through inter-disciplinary research among a broad spectrum of disciplines such as wireless systems, health, fashion, energy – to name a few. 
			We hope that this workshop will serve as a catalyst for advancements in mobile and wearable systems technology as well as present a clear sense of direction
			 for the research community to proceed in this space.
